 - Allow users to manage their personal account including the ability to change password or personal information

## Project Reflection
 - The project is built in 10 weeks. The project goal is to practice using Javascript and working with PHP as well as familiar myself with project documentation
 - The development follow Agile methodology of *software development life cycle*
 - This project continue to improve and reinforce my fundamental programming knowledge while expose to new material like:
    * Working with AJAX request, fetching and sending data to API under JSON format 
    * Using promises for asynchronous tasks
    * Organize code into separated module
    * Create CRUD actions and communicate to cloud database with PDO (PHP)
    *  Store user login data to browser using session
