 - The development follow Agile methodology of *software development life cycle*
 - This project continue to improve and reinforce my fundamental programming knowledge while expose to new material like:
    * Working with AJAX request, fetching and sending data to API under JSON format 
    * Using promises for asynchronous tasks
    * Organize code into separated module
    * Create CRUD actions and communicate to cloud database with PDO (PHP)
